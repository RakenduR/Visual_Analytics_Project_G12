      "contents": "\r\nA\r\nDeep Dive into the financial health of the city of Engagement, Ohio\r\nJeremiah Lam | Shachi\r\nRaodeo | Rakendu Ramesh\r\nA city or country’s economy plays an integral role in society, as\r\nbusinesses and individuals livelihoods depend on it. In an economic\r\nrecession, retrenchments are inevitable and businesses see a lost in\r\nrevenue, which may subsequently see them close down. Conversely, in an\r\neconomic boom, there’s an increase in both income and spending across\r\nbusinesses and individuals. Within an economy, there are patterns we can\r\nobserve, for example, how are businesses or sectors performing, how much\r\nare individuals spending, who are businesses employing.\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe VAST\r\nChallenge 2022 presented an exciting opportunity to\r\nunderstand and analyse the economy of the city of Engagement, Ohio. As a\r\ncity anticipating rapid growth, it is paramount to first understand the\r\ncurrent state of the city and identify opportunities for future growth.\r\nWe would like to make use of a range of visualisation techniques and\r\nvisual analytics to reveal the financial health of the city.\r\nWith the creation of a RShiny app, users will be able to:\r\nVisualise which are the prosperous and struggling businesses\r\n(i.e. pub, restaurants) in the city of Engagement, Ohio for the period\r\ndata was collected from its participants\r\nVisualise the income and overall cost of living for participants\r\nacross different age groups and education levels, and analyse patterns\r\nacross these groups living in the city of Engagement, Ohio for the\r\nperiod data was collected from them\r\nPredict the income of participants living in the city of\r\nEngagement, for the next 6-18 months, based on their age and education\r\nlevel, from the time data was collected from them\r\nVisualise the health of various employers within the city, based\r\non the jobs they’re offering to various education levels and their\r\nhourly rate\r\nAnalyse employment patterns based on the hourly rate and job\r\nopenings they’re offering to various education levels and age\r\ngroups\r\nIdentify areas in the city of Engagement with high turnover and\r\nareas with difficulty hiring applicants (i.e. 0 job applicants for the\r\njob role)\r\nProposal\r\nThe dataset was acquired from VAST\r\nChallenge 2022. It contains 3 large sets of data.\r\nActivity logs tracks the the daily activities of the\r\nparticipants in the city. Attributes contains the\r\nattributes of the city including the jobs that are offered, details of\r\nthe participants, employers, restaurants and pubs.\r\nJournals has information on where participants have\r\ngone, the spending and wages of participants and who they interacted\r\nwith.\r\nIn order to visualise the financial health of the city effectively, a\r\nmulti-pronged approach was considered, starting with a descriptive\r\nanalysis of the datasets by showing the :\r\nRevenue and foot-traffic of the various businesses (i.e. pubs and\r\nrestaurants) over time\r\nIncome and expenses of participants of different education levels\r\nand age groups over time\r\nJobs offered to various education levels and their respective\r\nhourly wage\r\nJobs with high turnover rates and jobs that employer’s are\r\nfinding difficult to fill\r\nThis will be conducted using line charts, histogram and barcharts,\r\nboxplots, sparklines and maps.\r\nNext, correlation analysis was conducted between average age hired\r\nfor a job, and the offered hourly rate or the number of jobs they were\r\nhired for. This was to glean any insights of any potential correlations\r\nbetween them. Also, a one-way ANOVA test was done between hourly wage,\r\nand either education level or age groups for average age hired, to see\r\nif there was any statistical evidence proving that there is a difference\r\nin mean hourly rate within different education levels or age groups\r\n(i.e. certain education levels getting paid more, certain age groups are\r\ngetting paid more).\r\nLastly, predictive analysis was conducted on the historical data\r\nprovided, in order to forecast future income of participants of\r\ndifferent age group and education levels. This was conducted by\r\nemploying a plethora of models such as ARIMA, ETS, TSLM and\r\nautoregressive models.\r\nWe hope that through our app, users will be able to better appreciate\r\nthe financial health of the city of Engagement, Ohio, as well as use our\r\napp to forecast the income of its participants to better anticipate the\r\neconomic state of the city.\r\nLastly, you may view our draft proposal here!\r\nRShiny App\r\nDo visit here\r\nto view our app!\r\nPoster\r\nDo visit here to view our poster!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
